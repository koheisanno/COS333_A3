Jacob Colchamiro Kohei Sanno

Kohei Sanno: I contributed to this project by working on the front end
and on error handling. I first created index.html, header.html, 
error.html, regdetails.html, and footer.html. I then implemented a 
preliminary version of registrar.py and got some basic queries running 
properly. Finally, I worked on some of the error handling and 
made sure our program matched the behavior of the reference for the 
errors listed in the assignment specs. 

Jacob Colchamiro: I contributed to this project by working on cookies,
making the webpage stateful, debugging, and testing. I first worked
on expanding Kohei's preliminary version to handle more complicated 
queries; this required a change in the way we processed arguments 
compared to how we did this in assignments 1 and 2. I then used cookies
to make the project better match the reference program. I edited the 
html files substantially throughout the process. Finally, I handled 
testing and pylint/style edits. 

We did not receive help from other people in working on this assignment. 

We relied on the course lectures, the lecture code handouts, and the 
class Ed forum substantially in working on this assignment. 

We spent about 11 hours working on this assignment. 

The assignment helped us to learn more about web programming and how to 
use Flask and Jinja2. We feel that these are all important things to 
learn that we had not had experience with before. This assignment was 
also a bit easier to test than Assignment 2, which we appreciated.
